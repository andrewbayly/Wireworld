# Wireworld

[LIVE DEMO](https://andrewbayly.github.io/Wireworld/index.html "Live Demo")

The folks at https://www.quinapalus.com/wi-index.html describe a Wireworld computer
that calculates primes. I took the design of the computer, and ran it on my own 
implementation of Wireworld (running in the browser), and the loaded a program, written 
in byte code, from a JSON file, and copied the program into the register bank. 

To run it, load index.html - the program, stored in program.js will automatically
load and start running. 

## program

THe program copies the number 5555 into the display, and then cycles back to the same 
instruction repeatedly. More complex programs can be written of course - see this page
https://www.quinapalus.com/wires10.html for details of the instruction set.
